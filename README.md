Great! The default `README.md` you have is generated by `create-next-app`, which is good for starting out, but since this is for an **internship assignment**, you'll want to **customize it to showcase your specific project** — the **PDF Annotation Tool Landing Page**.

Below is a **polished, formal replacement** for your current `README.md` that still keeps the helpful technical parts from the original but tailors everything specifically for your assignment:

---

```markdown
# 📄 PDF Annotation Tool - Landing Page

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project created for a **React Internship Assignment**. The goal of the project is to build a clean, responsive, and functional landing page that introduces a browser-based PDF Annotation Tool and encourages users to try it.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with the **App Router**
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Language**: JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- **Font**: [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) via [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)
